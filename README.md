# Todo Web App With Backbone.js #

This is an [Backbone.js](documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) example from [Todomvc](github.com/addyosmani/todomvc) repository. 

I rewrite the CSS file using [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), so that make it possible to learning HTML/CSS/SASS/JAVASCRIPT in one prject.

## Todos.js
This is a Todo list created with Backbone.js, using mvc.

## Style
This CSS file is generated using Compass. Compass uses Sass syntax and it is easy to use.
